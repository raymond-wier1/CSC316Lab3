# CSC316Lab3
This was also a lab I did for CSC316. The code I added was the jump button, camera controls, player movement, and the game over screen.
Controls:
    Left and Right move the character
    Hold Space to Jump
    WASD control the camera
The goal of the game is to avoid the obstacles for as long as possible.
